## Description

Our website allows a user to make an account and login.  As a donor, you can set your profile, add your information to a donor list, and schedule an appointment to give blood.  As a patient you or your medical representative can view the donor list for a donor who matches your blood type and contact them.  It uses Express.js and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.  The information stored in a database is then rendered to a donor list page through Handlebars.
